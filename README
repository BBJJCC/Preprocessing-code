# CSI Data Processing Tools

This project includes three Python scripts for handling Wi-Fi CSI datasets.

## 1. pcap to npy

- **File Name:** `1.py`
- **Functionality:** Converts .pcap files to .npy format for continuous CSI data.
- **Usage:** Run `python 1.py input.pcap output.npy`, where `input.pcap` is the input pcap file path and `output.npy` is the output npy file path.

## 2. Continuous Data Splitting

- **File Name:** `2.py`
- **Functionality:** Splits continuous npy files into multiple small files with a specified interval.
- **Usage:** Run `python 2.py input.npy output_dir interval`, where `input.npy` is the input npy file path, `output_dir` is the output directory path, and `interval` is the splitting interval (in milliseconds).

## 3. Dataset Partitioning

- **File Name:** `3.py`
- **Functionality:** Divides the dataset into training and testing sets according to a specified ratio.
- **Usage:** Run `python 3.py dataset_dir train_ratio`, where `dataset_dir` is the dataset directory path and `train_ratio` is the ratio of the dataset to be used for training (e.g., 0.8 means 80% of the data for training, 20% for testing).

## Dataset Download

You can download the Wi-Fi based personnel identity recognition CSI dataset from [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/csi-dataset-wi-fi-based-personnel-identity-recognition).
